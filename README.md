# Stardust
Theme inspired by GOG Galaxy 2.0 for [Playnite](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite) Desktop Mode.

## Tips and donations
All the work I do for Playnite extensions is and will always be free!

I make extensions and themes to learn, have fun and to give to the community so donations are not required or requested. If you find the work being done useful and you are and in a position that allows it, you can consider making a tip to support the different Playnite related projects I work on, every little bit helps.

## Feature Requests

If you have a new idea or feature suggestion, feel free to submit it via the [Issues Tracker](https://github.com/darklinkpower/Stardust/issues).

Before submitting:
- **Search for existing requests** to ensure your suggestion hasn't already been made.
- Consider whether the feature could already be achieved through Playnite's built-in settings or the [ThemeModifier plugin](https://playnite.link/addons.html#playnite-thememodifier-plugin).
- Clearly explain the feature, its benefits, and how it could improve the theme for most users.

#### A Note on Feature Requests

I truly appreciate everyone who enjoys using my themes and shares feedback. Due to time constraints and the significant effort I already invest in these projects in my free time, I focus on changes that benefit the majority of users.

Personalized adjustments, while appealing, require considerable time and effort to implement and maintain and can increase complexity. This increases the ongoing work with each update, making it harder for me to manage the project in the long run. Because of this, I prioritize features with broad utility.

For niche or highly specific requests (e.g., moving/removing elements or making tailored changes), I encourage you to try making these modifications yourself. While I understand not everyone may have the knowledge or experience, I want to highlight that I'm not a programmer but I've self-taught everything I know to work on my projects. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I'm unable to dedicate the time needed to teach these modifications, but with some effort, it's definitely possible to learn and implement them on your own.

I'm sorry if your request is denied for this reason, and I hope you can understand.

Thank you for your support.

## Theme goals
- Use GOG Galaxy 2.0 UI as inspiration to create a polished Playnite UI. The font used by it can be downloaded from [from here](https://www.1001freefonts.com/es/lato.font) to be used in Playnite. The font used by Playnite can be configured in `Settings` -> `Appearance` -> `Application font`
- Achieve a more modern and clean design with the chosen pallete and things like rounded corners in certain elements like the windows, borders, buttons and controls.
- Improve the user experience with small animations in certain parts.
- Change the aesthetic without affecting functionality.
- Polish certain parts of the UI to give a better user experience.
- Different aesthetic of other available themes available by default in Playnite and created by the community.
- Achieve features that are not available by default on Playnite via community extensions
