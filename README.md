# Stardust
Theme inspired by GOG Galaxy 2.0 for [Playnite](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite) Desktop Mode.

## Tips and donations
All the work I do for Playnite extensions is and will always be free!

I make extensions and themes to learn, have fun and to give to the community so donations are not required or requested. If you find the work being done useful and you are and in a position that allows it, you can consider making a tip to support the different Playnite related projects I work on, every little bit helps.

## Theme goals
- Use GOG Galaxy 2.0 UI as inspiration to create a polished Playnite UI. The font used by it can be downloaded from [from here](https://www.1001freefonts.com/es/lato.font) to be used in Playnite. The font used by Playnite can be configured in `Settings` -> `Appearance` -> `Application font`
- Achieve a more modern and clean design with the chosen pallete and things like rounded corners in certain elements like the windows, borders, buttons and controls.
- Improve the user experience with small animations in certain parts.
- Change the aesthetic without affecting functionality.
- Polish certain parts of the UI to give a better user experience.
- Different aesthetic of other available themes available by default in Playnite and created by the community.
- Achieve features that are not available by default on Playnite via community extensions
